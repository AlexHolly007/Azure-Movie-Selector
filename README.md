# Azure-Movie-Selector
This is a project created for the Microsoft Fabric Hackathon event. It will use Azure SQL database along with Azure openai to intelligently give movie suggestions based on a user input. The input is an open ended paragraph/sentence of the users movie desires. This will be analyzed with over 9000 movie overviews and their genres using a GPT engine.
